### API Stability Within a Released ROS Distribution [1.iv]/[1.vi]

`rosidl_typesupport_interface` will not break public API within a released ROS distribution, i.e. no major releases once the ROS distribution is released.

### ABI Stability Within a Released ROS Distribution [1.v]/[1.vi]

`rosidl_typesupport_interface` contains C code and therefore must be concerned with ABI stability, and will maintain ABI stability within a ROS distribution.

The features of `rosidl_typesupport_interface` are tested, and their tests are located in the test directory.

Most recent test results can be found [here](https://ci.ros2.org/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/rosidl_typesupport_interface).

### Public API Testing [4.ii]

The public API of `rosidl_typesupport_interface` is tested, and the tests are located in the test directory.

Most recent test results can be found [here](https://ci.ros2.org/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/rosidl_typesupport_interface).

### Coverage [4.iii]

`rosidl_typesupport_interface` follows the recommendations for ROS Core packages in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#code-coverage), and opts to use line coverage instead of branch coverage.

This includes:

- tracking and reporting line coverage statistics
- achieving and maintaining a reasonable branch line coverage (90-100%)
- no lines are manually skipped in coverage calculations

Changes are required to make a best effort to keep or increase coverage before being accepted, but decreases are allowed if properly justified and accepted by reviewers.

Because this package is a header only library with just C macro definitions, its coverage is not able to be reported.
The unit test of all its macros can be found in the test directory.

### Performance [4.iv]

`rosidl_typesupport_interface` does not have performance tests because this package contains simple interface macros that define the naming convention for typesupport symbols.
These macros do not introduce any runtime overhead when used.
Therefore it has been decided that this package does not need performance tests to qualify for Quality Level 1.

### Linters and Static Analysis [4.v]

`rosidl_typesupport_interface` uses and passes all the standard linters and static analysis tools for a C package as described in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#linters-and-static-analysis).

Results of the linting tests can be found [here](https://ci.ros2.org/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/rosidl_typesupport_interface/).

## Dependencies [5]

### Direct Runtime ROS Dependencies [5.i/5.ii]

`rosidl_typesupport_interface` does not have any runtime ROS dependencies.

It has "buildtool" dependencies, which do not affect the resulting quality of the package, because they do not contribute to the public library API.
It also has several test dependencies, which do not affect the resulting quality of the package, because they are only used to build and run the test code.

### Direct Runtime Non-ROS Dependencies [5.iii]

`rosidl_typesupport_interface` does not have any runtime non-ROS dependencies.

## Platform Support [6]

`rosidl_typesupport_interface` supports all of the tier 1 platforms as described in [REP-2000](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html#support-tiers), and tests each change against all of them.

Currently nightly results can be seen here:
* [linux-aarch64_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux-aarch64_release/lastBuild/testReport/rosidl_typesupport_interface/)
* [linux_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/rosidl_typesupport_interface/)
